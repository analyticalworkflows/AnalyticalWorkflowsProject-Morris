# AnalyticalWorkflowsProject-Morris
The actual repository I can use for my organizational attempts 
I am going to attempt to make a clean and organizaed project folder which I can use to help with future projects
This will include my peromyscus passion project measurement data
---
## *Peromyscus sp* Measurements
### Passion Project 

Species represented in this list are:
1. *Peromyscus maniuculatus*
2. *Peromyscus crinitus*
3. *Peromyscus truei*

They are _nearly_ identical when in the fossil record/broken up, so the goal is to have the different species measured in different ways to get a range of sizes down for the sake of narrowing species IDs down.
